Transform Nested Data into Top-Level Data

Helping Klaviyo Users Unlock Better Segmentation & Automation


🚀 What Problem Does This Solve?:


Klaviyo (and many segmentation tools) struggle with nested data because they only support top-level attributes.
Previously, Klaviyo users had no direct solution—forcing them to hire developers or rely on third-party partners.
This solution provides a clear example of how to transform nested data, making it usable within Klaviyo without extensive development work.



🎯 Who Is This For?:



✅ Klaviyo customers who need advanced segmentation but struggle with complex data formats.

✅ Marketing teams looking to use detailed order, customer, or event data in flows.

✅ Developers who want an easy-to-follow API and webhook solution.



🔑 What This Solution Enables:



✨ Seamless Segmentation: Convert nested data into top-level attributes that Klaviyo can read.

✨ Automation with Webhooks: Process event data in real-time and send clean data back.

✨ More Powerful Targeting: Use previously inaccessible order details, customer preferences, or event properties.



🛠 How It Works (Simplified Flow):



1️⃣ Klaviyo Event Triggered
→ A customer places an order (or another event occurs).

2️⃣ Webhook Sends Data to Napkin.io
→ The raw, nested data is sent for processing.

3️⃣ Data is Transformed (Flattened)
→ The script extracts key details and restructures them.

4️⃣ Transformed Data is Sent Back to Klaviyo
→ Now, it's usable for segmentation, triggers, or conditional splits.


🔎 Key Features:



✅ API & Webhook Integration – Automate data flow between Klaviyo and Napkin.io.

✅ Data Transformation – Flatten complex structures to unlock new segmentation options.

✅ Timestamping & Error Handling – Ensure clean, reliable event data.

✅ No Need for Custom Dev Work – Provides an out-of-the-box example to get started.


📌 Easy Setup:



1️⃣ In Klaviyo:
Generate an API Key.
Set up a Metric with nested data (e.g., “Placed Order” event).
Configure a webhook to send data.

2️⃣ In Napkin.io:
Sign up & create a function.
Copy your webhook destination URL.
Enable API authentication & paste your Klaviyo webhook data.

3️⃣ Set Up Webhook Flow:
Create a new flow in Klaviyo.
Add a "Metric Trigger" (e.g., Placed Order).
Attach a "Webhook" action using the Napkin.io URL.


💡 Why This Matters for Klaviyo Users:



Before:

❌ Nested data was difficult to use.

❌ Segmentation was limited.

❌ No official solution—users had to hire developers or external agencies.


Now:

✅ Klaviyo users finally have an actionable example.

✅ Segmentation & automation become more powerful.

✅ No need for external development resources.
